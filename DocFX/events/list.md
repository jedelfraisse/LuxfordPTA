## 📅 General Membership Meetings

The PTA will hold three General Membership Meetings during the 2025-2026 school year:

- **October**  
- **January**  
- **May**

All parents and guardians are encouraged to attend these meetings to stay informed about school activities, participate in important decisions, and connect with the PTA board and other families. Specific dates and times will be announced in advance of each meeting.

Before each PTA event, we will hold a planning event to gather input, discuss agenda items, and coordinate upcoming activities. These planning sessions may be virtual or held at the school, and all are welcome to participate to help make every event a success.
